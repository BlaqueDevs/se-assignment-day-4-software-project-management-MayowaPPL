Quality control (QC) identifies defects in the final product, ensuring the software meets its functional and non-functional requirements​.

Maintaining high standards is important to avoid costly errors, ensure customer satisfaction, and build trust. Projects that fail to meet quality standards often face issues like poor performance, security vulnerabilities, and increased maintenance costs. High-quality software is more reliable, easier to maintain, and enhances user experience, ultimately contributing to the project's success​.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
**Answer**: 
Defining the project scope establishes clear boundaries for the project, listing all deliverables and objectives. This clarity prevents scope creep, ensures that the project stays on track, and helps allocate resources efficiently. A well-defined scope is essential for effective planning and managing stakeholder expectations​.

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a tool used to break the project down into smaller, manageable tasks. It organizes the project's deliverables and tasks in a hierarchical format, making it easier to assign responsibilities, estimate timelines, and track progress. The WBS ensures that no critical tasks are overlooked and aids in efficient resource allocation​.


## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
**Answer**: 
A detailed project schedule helps in organizing tasks, setting realistic deadlines, and tracking progress.
